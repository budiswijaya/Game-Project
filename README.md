# Wild Ones / Gunbound Web Game Project

## Physic logic

This project explores the basics of physics in a game environment, including collision handling, terrain destruction, and gravity simulation.

I started this project purely out of curiosity and as a hobby—wanting to understand how games like this are built. It’s not intended as a “real-world” production project, but as a way to explore, experiment, and learn. Working on it has helped me see the capabilities of coding in action and understand what kinds of structures and logic needed to create more complex systems.

While I cannot claim full originality over the code, I do understand the overall flow and function of its parts. Going through this project has deepened my appreciation for the mechanics behind games and has been an enjoyable way to expand my coding knowledge and widen my creative thinking.

There is still much room for improvement, and development is currently paused while I focus on other projects.
